Hero System
===========
This is me coming up with the idea for the hero system for the clicker game.

The Details
-----------
- Purchase 5 of the 100+ heroes in the base game for bonuses and increased GPS.
- Getting rid of a hero might require the player to prestige or it will cost them gold to remove (that hero's level is also reset).
    - If a hero recieves a change the player can trade the hero for a hero of equal value (the level reseting remains thought).
- Each hero has unique abilities (not particulary ones from the game, just ones that fit with the hero).
- Level up the hero using gold (maybe also exp as a currency gained only over time).
- A leveled up hero gains a skill point, which gives the player the ability to choose an ability to level.
- Heroes can have 6 items, just like the base game, these items will boost specific aspects of the heroes (items will be more indepth in `ITEMS_SYSTEM.md`).
- Heroes will have stats:
    - Strength: TBD
    - Intelligence: TBD
    - Agility: Increases the hero's GPS boost.
