Dota 2 Clicker
==============
Just some clicker game I'm making to learn some HTML, JS, and CSS, nothing really interesting imo.  
I'm using code from cookie clicker, because I wouldn't know what to do otherwise.  

Planned Features

The ones with boxes that are checked means that they are implemented, duh.
- [x] Click mechanic (click a region and increment a number)
- [x] Gold per second mechanic (a number to increase the current gold by per second)
- [x] Shop region CSS
- [x] Main HTML
- [x] Main CSS
- [ ] Purchasable products in the store
